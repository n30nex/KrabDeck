# Contributing to SigurdOS T-Deck

Thanks for considering contributing! This project is in beta and welcomes
bug reports, feature requests, and code contributions.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/hermes-gadget/SlopOS-tdeck.git
cd SlopOS-tdeck
pio test -e native_test -v
```

**Important:** MeshCore lives as a git submodule at `lib/meshcore/`. If you cloned without `--recurse-submodules`, run `git submodule update --init` — nothing compiles without it.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows a **no-drama** policy. Be respectful, constructive, and
assume good faith. Harassment, trolling, and personal attacks will not be
tolerated.

## Reporting Bugs

1. Search [open issues](https://github.com/hermes-gadget/SlopOS-tdeck/issues)
   first — your bug may already be known.
2. If not found, open a new issue with:
   - A clear, descriptive title
   - Steps to reproduce (exact and minimal)
   - Expected vs. actual behavior
   - T-Deck hardware revision (v1.0 / v1.1), if known
   - Serial monitor logs (run `pio device monitor -b 115200`)
3. Label the issue `bug`.

## Suggesting Features

1. Search existing issues for `[Feature request]`.
2. Open a new issue with `[Feature request]` in the title.
3. Describe the use case and the problem it solves.
4. Sketch the desired behavior or UI — code snippets help.

## Submitting Code Changes

### Before you start

1. **Open an issue first** describing what you want to work on — even for small changes. This lets maintainers know someone is working on it and avoids duplicate effort.
2. Label the issue appropriately (`bug`, `enhancement`, `docs`, etc.).
3. Small fixes (typos, comments, one-line bug fixes) can skip the issue step if discussed with a maintainer first.
4. **Check `docs/MISSING_FEATURES.md`** before implementing a new feature. If the capability is already catalogued there, you have a head start — MeshCore source references and effort estimates are provided.

### Work on it

1. **Fork the repo** on GitHub.
2. **Create a branch on your fork** from the `dev` branch:
   ```
   git checkout dev
   git pull upstream dev
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   # or: feature/your-feature
   # or: docs/your-doc-change
   ```
3. **Make your changes** — keep commits atomic and descriptive.
4. **Write or update tests** — all tests must pass before merging:
   ```
   pio test -e native_test -v
   ```
5. **Ensure it builds** for the target hardware:
   ```
   pio run -e SigurdOS_TDeck
   ```
6. **Push to your fork** and open a PR against the `dev` branch.
7. In the PR description, reference the related issue (`Fixes #123`).
8. If you discovered new issues during testing, add them to `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`.
9. Respond to review feedback promptly.

### After merging

Once the PR is merged, the maintainer closes the original issue with notes describing what was done and the outcome. This keeps the issue tracker clean and provides a record of the fix or feature for future reference.

### Who Can Merge

Only the repository maintainers (Ben and the Hermes agent) have merge access. Pull request authors and other contributors cannot merge their own PRs. This ensures every merge goes through review by someone familiar with the full codebase.

### Merging

Pull requests are merged via `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`. Squash merging keeps the commit history on `dev` clean — each PR becomes one atomic commit. Feature branches are deleted after merge.

### Hardware Testing

For any non-trivial change (anything beyond a typo, comment, or obvious one-line fix), the PR must be tested on actual hardware by a maintainer before merging. Do not merge AI agent or contributor PRs with substantive changes until hardware-tested. Small fixes can be merged on code review alone.

### Pull Request Guidelines

- **One feature / fix = one PR.** Smaller PRs are reviewed faster.
- Use descriptive commit messages:
  - Good: `Fix I2C timeout handling on ESP32`
  - Bad: `update`
- Keep the PR focused — don't sneak in unrelated changes.
- If you change public API or UI, update relevant documentation.
- New screens or features should include LVGL integration tests.

### PR Template

When opening a pull request, use this structure in the description:

```markdown
## Summary
<!-- Brief description of the change and why it's needed -->

Fixes #ISSUE_NUMBER

## Testing
<!-- REQUIRED: State how hardware testing was done -->

Testing method: [Remote test / Physical hardware test / Both]

<!--
Remote test = SigurdOS_TDeck_remote_test build env, serial-controlled simulation
Physical hardware test = flashed to real T-Deck, verified by human
-->

## Checklist
- [ ] `pio test -e native_test -v` passes
- [ ] `pio run -e SigurdOS_TDeck` builds
- [ ] No new warnings or errors
- [ ] docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md updated (if applicable)
```

### Protected Files

The following files require separate PRs and cannot be bundled with feature or bug fix PRs. Any PR touching these files will require CODEOWNER review and approval:

- `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md` — AI agent context
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — contribution guidelines
- `docs/KNOWN_ISSUES.md` — known issues tracker
- `docs/MISSING_FEATURES.md` — missing features roadmap
- `.github/workflows/*` — CI/CD pipeline

If you need to change one of these, open a dedicated PR with only that change. Do not bury protected file changes inside a larger feature PR — they will be rejected.

## Development Workflow

```
upstream/dev  ─────►  your-fork/dev
                          │
                    git checkout -b feature/foo
                          │
                    commits...
                          │
                    push && open PR ──► upstream/dev
```

- The `dev` branch is the integration branch — all PRs merge here. There is no `main` branch; releases are tagged directly on `dev`.
- Rebase your branch on `dev` before opening a PR to avoid merge conflicts:
  ```
  git fetch upstream
  git rebase upstream/dev
  ```

## Style Guide

Follow the existing C++ style (no `.clang-format` file — conventions are listed below):

| Convention | Rule |
|------------|------|
| Indentation | 2 spaces, no tabs |
| Functions & variables | `camelCase` |
| Class names | `UpperCamelCase` / `PascalCase` |
| Constants (`#define`) | `ALL_CAPS` |
| Line length | ~100 characters max |

Consistency with surrounding code takes priority over strict rules.

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests (no hardware needed)
pio test -e native_test -v

# Run a specific module
pio test -e native_test -f test_battery -v
```

### Test structure

PlatformIO discovers tests in `test/test_<name>/` directories. Each suite needs its own directory with a `main.cpp` entry point — `test/unit/` or `test/integration/` is not discovered.

### Coverage expectations

Every module should include unit tests:

| Module | What to test |
|--------|-------------|
| HAL (battery, touch, keyboard, GPS) | ADC formulas, coordinate mapping, I2C protocol, NMEA parsing |
| Mesh wrapper | API contract, return value ranges, message queue |
| Navigation | Screen routing, back-stack logic, same-screen noop |
| Theme | Color contrast, brightness hierarchy, constant consistency |
| Build integration | All headers compile together without conflicts |

New screens or features should include at least basic integration tests (navigation routing, message display, widget lifecycle). Tests run on the native host — no hardware needed.

### Hardware Testing

For hardware-validated PR testing, flash the debug build and check serial output:

```bash
# Build debug firmware
pio run -e SigurdOS_TDeck_debug

# Flash to device (via USB or remote gateway)
# Local: pio run -e SigurdOS_TDeck_debug -t upload
# Remote: scp .bin to gateway, flash via esptool

# Capture boot log (adjust port as needed)
# Local: pio device monitor -b 115200 --port <port>
# Remote: ssh <gateway> "stty -F <port> 115200 raw -echo && timeout 15 cat <port>" > /tmp/boot-log.txt
```

Verify in the boot log:
- No `FATAL` or `CRASH` or `PANIC` errors
- All `[boot] step N:` messages appear in sequence
- `[mesh] SlopMesh initialized` confirms radio init
- `[boot] === SigurdOS T-Deck ready ===` at the end

## Design Guide

The UI follows a **pixel / blocky retro aesthetic** inspired by Discord's dark theme on an 8-bit display. Key principles:

### Palette

| Role | Hex | Notes |
|------|-----|-------|
| Background (primary) | `#0F0F0F` | Deep black, not navy |
| Background (secondary) | `#181818` | Status bars, dialog backgrounds |
| Background (tertiary) | `#1E1E1E` | Card backgrounds, incoming bubbles |
| Background (input) | `#252525` | Text input fields |
| Accent | `#00BFFF` | Bright cyan, buttons and highlights |
| Text (primary) | `#F2F3F5` | Crisp white on dark |
| Text (secondary) | `#949BA4` | Subtitles, metadata |

Theme constants are defined in `src/ui/theme.h`.

### Layout

- **Zero radius** everywhere — no pill buttons, no round cards. Use `lv_obj_set_style_radius(obj, 0, 0)`.
- **2px minimum borders** — cards, inputs, and buttons get thick solid outlines from the palette.
- **4-column grid** on the home screen (320px T-Deck), no scrolling, 12 tiles per page. Smaller displays auto-adapt via `src/ui/responsive.h`.

### Typography

- Use LVGL's built-in Montserrat at small sizes (10px-14px) — it reads naturally blocky on the 320x240 TFT.
- Icon labels use LV_SYMBOL_* vector icons (FontAwesome bundle built into LVGL) — not emoji, not raw Unicode.
- Prefer `LV_SYMBOL_LIST` for the hamburger (≡) icon and `LV_SYMBOL_LEFT` for back (←) buttons over raw code points.

### Consistency

- All screens should call `apply_dark_bg()` and `apply_topbar_icon_btn()` from `src/ui/theme.h`.
- Screens share a `make_screen()` helper with a ← back button and dark top bar — use it instead of building custom top bars.
- When in doubt, match the style of an existing screen rather than introducing a new visual pattern.

## AI Use

AI agents and AI-assisted development are welcome — this project makes extensive use of them. However:

- All code generated by AI should be thoroughly reviewed by the contributor before submitting a PR.
- Changes should be tightly scoped to the bug fix or feature — no scope creep.
- The contributor must understand what the code does and how it fits into the broader firmware architecture.
- AI-generated code that introduces non-obvious dependencies, unsafe memory access patterns, or bypasses the theme/test conventions will be rejected.
- Use the [Code Audit Checklist](AGENTS.md#code-audit-checklist) to review your own work before submitting.
