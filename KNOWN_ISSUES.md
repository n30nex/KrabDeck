## Chat Screen

### Message scroll limiting
The chat view has no upper bound on how many messages it buffers in memory. After extended use (especially on busy mesh networks with many nodes), the message list grows unbounded, consuming PSRAM and eventually causing slowdowns or crashes.

**What's needed:** A configurable message cap (e.g. 200-500 messages), with oldest messages evicted as new ones arrive. The cap should be per-channel so a busy channel doesn't starve quieter ones.

### Channel selection — message preview clipping
When scrolling through channels in the channel selector, message previews (the last message in each channel) don't properly truncate. Long messages overflow the preview area and clip visually, overlapping adjacent UI elements.

**What's needed:** Proper string truncation in the channel list — clamp preview text to fit the available width, appending "..." when truncated. The `build_channel_string` function in `home_screen.cpp` was recently hardened (PR #29) — a similar approach should be applied to the preview text in the channel selector.

## Signal Bars

### RSSI-based signal strength indicator
There's no visual signal strength indicator anywhere in the UI. Users have to navigate to the Heard screen and read raw RSSI numbers to gauge link quality.

**What's needed:** A small signal bar widget (1-5 bars) based on the last received message's RSSI from each contact. Bars should be rendered with the pixel aesthetic — blocky, no curves. Reference threshold levels:

| Bars | RSSI Range |
|------|-----------|
| 5    | > -70 dBm |
| 4    | -70 to -85 dBm |
| 3    | -85 to -95 dBm |
| 2    | -95 to -105 dBm |
| 1    | < -105 dBm |

Could be shown next to each contact in the Contacts screen, in the chat header, and on the home screen mesh status.

## Finder

### Zero-hop ping for nearby discovery
The finder feature needs a proper implementation that sends a zero-hop (TTL=1) ping to discover nearby repeaters. Currently there's no way to probe what's in immediate radio range without relying on periodic adverts.

**What's needed:**
- A "Ping Nearby" action that sends a broadcast with hop limit = 1
- A response handler that collects replies over a short window (2-3 seconds)
- Display results grouped by RSSI (strongest first)
- Cooldown of 30 seconds between pings to avoid flooding

## Heard Screen → Packets Screen — ✅ Fixed

### Replaced with raw packet log
The Heard screen has been replaced with a raw packet log ("Packets" on the home screen) showing the last 50 received transmissions with timestamps, source, RSSI, SNR, and payload type (ADVERT, DM, CHANNEL, ANON).

**What was done:**
- Renamed home screen icon from "HEARD" to "PACKETS" with `LV_SYMBOL_LIST`
- Replaced the tabular node-list view with a scrollable packet log (newest first)
- Each entry shows: `HH:MM` timestamp, source name (truncated with `...`), RSSI value (color-coded green/orange/red), SNR value, and packet type (color-coded)
- Added `_onPacket` callback to `SlopMesh` that fires for every received packet (advert, DM, channel message, anonymous data) with source, RSSI, SNR, and type
- RSSI is captured from the radio driver at the moment the packet is received (alongside SNR from `Packet._snr`)
- Packet log buffer stores up to 50 entries in `mesh_wrapper.cpp` via `logPacket()` callback
- Exposed via `getPacketLogCount()` / `getPacketLogEntry()` in `mesh_wrapper.h`

## Map Screen — ✅ Fixed

### Rendered offline map tiles from SD
PR #42 (gadgethd) implemented the full offline map tile system:
- PNG tile decode via lodepng with PSRAM-backed cache (4 tiles, ~524KB)
- Ripple-compatible `/tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}.png` path structure (same as Ripple firmware)
- Auto-discovery of tile coverage via SD directory scan
- Auto-center on available tile set
- `clamp_view_to_coverage()` keeps pan/zoom within available tiles
- Direct canvas pixel copy for performance, 200ms rate-limited render
- PSRAM-first allocator for all tile/canvas buffers
- Deferred initial render (250ms) to avoid blocking screen transition
- Extended map touch events for drag pan
- Hardware tested on LilyGo T-Deck with z10-z14 tile set

## Terminal

### Undocumented commands
The built-in serial/diagnostics terminal exposes several internal commands but there's no documentation on what's available or what each command does. Users have to read the source code to discover features.

**What's needed:** A `help` command that lists all available commands with a one-line description. A `help <command>` variant that shows usage details. The help text should be stored as a single `const char*` array in `src/ui/terminal.cpp` so it stays easy to update.

Common commands that should be documented:
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `help` | List available commands |
| `status` | Show mesh status, node count, uptime |
| `channels` | List joined channels |
| `nodes` | List known nodes |
| `signal` | Show RSSI/SNR for last heard transmission |
| `send <text>` | Send a text message to the current channel |
| `save` | Force save state to NVS |
| `reset` | Reboot the device |
| `gps` | Show current GPS fix data |

## Radio Setup

### Custom RF parameters — ✅ Fixed
The Radio Setup screen now has a "Custom RF..." button below the frequency presets that opens a pixel-themed dialog with +/- dial controls for all five radio parameters (frequency, spreading factor, bandwidth, coding rate, transmit power). Values persist through the existing Save & Reboot flow.

## Launcher Compatibility

### SlopOS doesn't work under bmorcelli/Launcher
[Launcher](https://github.com/bmorcelli/Launcher) is an ESP32 app launcher with explicit T-Deck support (display, touch, keyboard, SD card). A user tried running SlopOS as a Launcher-launched app and ran into problems — the keyboard doesn't work properly, and many other things break.

**Root cause:** SlopOS is built as standalone firmware that expects full hardware control at boot. Launcher initialises the display, keyboard, I2C, SPI, and LoRa pins before handing off, which leaves GPIOs, peripheral registers, and I2C bus state in an incompatible state when SlopOS starts.

**What's needed — a `launcher-compatible` build target or a compatibility layer:**
- Ensure all peripheral init (keyboard I2C, display, LoRa SPI, GPIOs, PSRAM) is safe to re-init even if already configured by a bootloader or launcher
- Partition table must coexist with Launcher's OTA partition scheme — likely needs a unified partition layout
- Display handoff: ST7789 registers may be in an unknown state — LovyanGFX handles this on init but needs testing
- LoRa radio: Launcher disables LoRa CS for SD card access — SlopOS needs to fully reset and re-init the SX1262 on boot
- Keyboard: the I2C keyboard MCU (0x55) may already be claimed or in key mode — must force re-init via Wire + backlight commands
- Trackball GPIOs may have internal pull states changed by Launcher — need explicit `pinMode` re-init
- LoRa SPI bus (shared with display) must be safely re-initialised without conflicting with any prior configuration
