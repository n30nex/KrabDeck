## Chat Screen

### Channel selection — message preview clipping
When scrolling through channels in the channel selector, message previews (the last message in each channel) don't properly truncate. Long messages overflow the preview area and clip visually, overlapping adjacent UI elements.

**What's needed:** Proper string truncation in the channel list — clamp preview text to fit the available width, appending "..." when truncated. The `build_channel_string` function in `home_screen.cpp` was recently hardened (PR #29) — a similar approach should be applied to the preview text in the channel selector.


## Trackball Navigation

### Universal back-swipe not implemented
The trackball left-swipe (back/navigate to previous screen) currently only works on the Chat screen (PR #21). Every other screen requires reaching for the back button in the top-left corner, which is awkward during one-handed use.

**What's needed:** Make the trackball left-swipe a universal back gesture on every screen. Implementation pattern from `chat_screen.cpp` should be extracted into `navigation.cpp/h` so all screens can register a back-swipe handler.

However, this needs to handle screens that have their own left/right navigation (e.g. scrolling through contacts alphabetically, paging through channel lists, or horizontal content). On those screens, a single left-swipe would conflict with the screen's own navigation. Two approaches:
- **Two-swipe commit:** The first left-swipe deselects/neutralises the current screen's navigation state (e.g. exits the scroll context). The second left-swipe then triggers the back gesture. This gives the user a deliberate two-step flow — "navigate past content, then go back."
- **Timing-based:** A quick left swipe scrolls the content; a longer hold-and-swipe-left triggers the back gesture. Differentiable by swipe speed/duration.
- **Edge zone:** Only trigger back-swipe when the trackball is swiped left from a neutral/resting state (no active list selection). If the user is actively scrolling a channel list, the left swipe scrolls the list instead.

The two-swipe commit approach is the most intuitive and least prone to accidental backs. It also gives clear visual feedback — the first swipe can clear any selection highlights or scroll to the top of the list, making it obvious that the next left swipe will go back.

## Signal Bars

### RSSI-based signal strength indicator
There's no visual signal strength indicator anywhere in the UI. Users have to navigate to the Heard screen and read raw RSSI numbers to gauge link quality.

**What's needed:** A small signal bar widget (1-5 bars) based on the last received message's RSSI from each contact. Bars should be rendered with the pixel aesthetic — blocky, no curves. Reference threshold levels:

| Bars | RSSI Range |
|------|-----------|
| 5    | > -70 dBm |
| 4    | -70 to -85 dBm |
| 3    | -85 to -95 dBm |
| 2    | -95 to -105 dBm |
| 1    | < -105 dBm |

Could be shown next to each contact in the Contacts screen, in the chat header, and on the home screen mesh status.

## Finder

### Zero-hop ping for nearby discovery
The finder feature needs a proper implementation that sends a zero-hop (TTL=1) ping to discover nearby repeaters. Currently there's no way to probe what's in immediate radio range without relying on periodic adverts.

**What's needed:**
- A "Ping Nearby" action that sends a broadcast with hop limit = 1
- A response handler that collects replies over a short window (2-3 seconds)
- Display results grouped by RSSI (strongest first)
- Cooldown of 30 seconds between pings to avoid flooding

---

## Terminal

### Undocumented commands
The built-in serial/diagnostics terminal exposes several internal commands but there's no documentation on what's available or what each command does. Users have to read the source code to discover features.

**What's needed:** A `help` command that lists all available commands with a one-line description. A `help <command>` variant that shows usage details. The help text should be stored as a single `const char*` array in `src/ui/terminal.cpp` so it stays easy to update.

Common commands that should be documented:
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `help` | List available commands |
| `status` | Show mesh status, node count, uptime |
| `channels` | List joined channels |
| `nodes` | List known nodes |
| `signal` | Show RSSI/SNR for last heard transmission |
| `send <text>` | Send a text message to the current channel |
| `save` | Force save state to NVS |
| `reset` | Reboot the device |
| `gps` | Show current GPS fix data |

## Launcher Compatibility

### SlopOS doesn't work under bmorcelli/Launcher
[Launcher](https://github.com/bmorcelli/Launcher) is an ESP32 app launcher with explicit T-Deck support (display, touch, keyboard, SD card). A user tried running SlopOS as a Launcher-launched app and ran into problems — the keyboard doesn't work properly, and many other things break.

**Root cause:** SlopOS is built as standalone firmware that expects full hardware control at boot. Launcher initialises the display, keyboard, I2C, SPI, and LoRa pins before handing off, which leaves GPIOs, peripheral registers, and I2C bus state in an incompatible state when SlopOS starts.

**What's needed — a `launcher-compatible` build target or a compatibility layer:**
- Ensure all peripheral init (keyboard I2C, display, LoRa SPI, GPIOs, PSRAM) is safe to re-init even if already configured by a bootloader or launcher
- Partition table must coexist with Launcher's OTA partition scheme — likely needs a unified partition layout
- Display handoff: ST7789 registers may be in an unknown state — LovyanGFX handles this on init but needs testing
- LoRa radio: Launcher disables LoRa CS for SD card access — SlopOS needs to fully reset and re-init the SX1262 on boot
- Keyboard: the I2C keyboard MCU (0x55) may already be claimed or in key mode — must force re-init via Wire + backlight commands
- Trackball GPIOs may have internal pull states changed by Launcher — need explicit `pinMode` re-init
- LoRa SPI bus (shared with display) must be safely re-initialised without conflicting with any prior configuration

## UI Performance

### LVGL tick starvation during LoRa TX
The main loop calls `slopos::mesh::loop()` (which may do blocking LoRa TX/RX taking 100-500ms) before `lv_timer_handler()`. During that period, LVGL is not serviced, causing visible UI stuttering — animations freeze, button feedback lags, and scrolling jerks.

**What's needed:** Defer long mesh operations to a separate task or state machine, interleave `lv_timer_handler()` calls during mesh loop iterations, or use FreeRTOS task priorities to keep LVGL responsive.

---

## Mesh Networking

### Channel hash lookup only checks first byte
The `searchChannelsByHash` function in `slop_mesh.h` compares only the first byte of the 32-byte channel hash to find a matching channel. With 8 channels and uniformly random hashes, there is an ~11% collision probability. When a collision occurs, an encrypted group message is decrypted with the wrong channel key, producing garbage text and displaying the wrong channel name.

**What's needed:** Replace the single-byte `hash[0] == _channels[i].channel.hash[0]` comparison with a full `memcmp` of the entire hash array.

### No contact expiry / eviction
The contact list has a hard cap of 64 entries (`SLOP_MAX_CONTACTS`). Once full, new contacts are silently dropped. There is no TTL-based eviction, LRU replacement, or purge of stale entries. Contacts not seen for hours or days still occupy a slot, preventing discovery of new nodes.

**What's needed:** Implement periodic eviction — purge contacts with `last_seen` older than a configurable threshold (e.g. 30 minutes) when the list is full.

### Advert rate limiting at mesh layer only
The 10-second advert cooldown is only enforced in the UI (button disabled state). The `sendAdvert()` function in `mesh_wrapper.cpp` has no rate-limiting of its own — it can be called programmatically (e.g. from the Terminal's `advert` command) without protection, potentially flooding the mesh.

**What's needed:** Add a timestamp check in `sendAdvert()` that rejects calls within `ADVERT_COOLDOWN_SECONDS`.

### Missing null-termination on short payloads
In `slop_mesh.h`, the payload text null-termination is conditional: `if (len > 1) data[len - 1] = '\0'`. For `len == 1`, no null byte is written, so the C string read from `data` may run past the buffer, causing undefined behavior or leaking stack data.

**What's needed:** Always null-terminate: `data[len - 1] = '\0';` unconditionally.

---

## Map Screen

### LRU cache clock uint32_t wrap
The tile LRU cache uses a `uint32_t cache_clock` that increments monotonically. After ~4 billion increments (or ~50 days of continuous use at 1kHz), it wraps to 0, breaking cache eviction comparisons — newly cached tiles have lower `last_used` values than old ones, causing premature eviction of recently used tiles.

**What's needed:** Use `uint64_t` for `cache_clock`, or implement a wrapping-aware comparison.

---

## Touch / Input

### I2C bus speed race — touch runs at 100kHz instead of 400kHz
The I2C bus is shared between the GT911 touch controller (400kHz capable) and the keyboard MCU (100kHz). The init sequence sets 400kHz for touch, then overwrites it to 100kHz during keyboard init. After that, ALL subsequent I2C operations (including touch reads) run at 100kHz. Touch is functional but reads at 1/4 speed, increasing touch latency by ~3-4x.

**What's needed:** Restore `Wire.setClock(400000)` after keyboard init completes, or use 100kHz for both (GT911 works at any speed up to 400kHz).

### Trackball LEFT fires on both edges
All trackball directions fire on falling edge only (one event per physical detent). LEFT fires on BOTH rising and falling edges, producing 2 events per detent. The 80ms deadtime (vs 150ms for others) doesn't prevent the double-fire — it only limits the minimum inter-event gap. In UI navigation, moving LEFT advances 2 items while other directions advance 1.

**What's needed:** Change LEFT to fire on falling edge only (same as other directions), or implement edge-agnostic debounce that fires exactly once per detent.

---

## Screen Navigation

### Navigation history stack is broken
The navigation system uses a circular buffer with MAX_HISTORY=8. `push_history` wraps around and overwrites the oldest entry when full. `pop_history` decrements `history_top` without wrapping — after wrapping occurs, it reads `history[-1]` (out-of-bounds, undefined behavior). The stack can only hold 8 items but there are 14+ screen types.

**What's needed:** Replace the circular buffer with a simple linear stack: drop the oldest entry when full instead of wrapping. Fix `pop_history` to never read below index 0.

---

## Chat Screen

### REPEATERS tile navigates to Packets screen instead of a nodes/repeaters view
The REPEATERS tile on the home screen 4x3 grid navigates to `Screen::Heard` — the same raw Packets log as the PACKETS tile (`home_screen.cpp:62-64`). Both tiles open identical screens. FINDER correctly navigates to `Screen::Network`. There is no dedicated screen for listing nearby nodes by signal strength.

**What's needed:** Either create a dedicated repeaters/nodes screen that lists known contacts sorted by RSSI, or redirect REPEATERS to `Screen::Network` (Finder) which already surfaces nearby nodes. The current double-mapping gives users two identical icon tiles with no functional difference.

---

## Onboarding

### ESP.restart() without flash write completion
The onboarding screen's Done button calls `ESP.restart()` immediately after `chat_save_messages()`. If the SPIFFS write hasn't completed (due to write caching), the save data is lost after reboot.

**What's needed:** Add a small delay (`delay(100)`) between the save and the restart, or set a flag for the main loop to handle the restart.

---

## GPS

### No NMEA checksum validation
Raw GPS NMEA sentences from the L76K module include a `*XX` checksum suffix that is never validated (`gps.cpp`). Corrupted sentences from noisy GPS reception are parsed as valid data, potentially giving incorrect coordinates, altitude, or fix status.

**What's needed:** Implement NMEA checksum validation — extract the checksum from after the `*` in the sentence, compute XOR of all bytes between `$` and `*`, and compare. Discard sentences that don't match.

---

## Terminal

### Unbounded label accumulation
Each command in the Terminal screen creates a new LVGL label widget (`screens.cpp:1221-1227`). There is no upper bound or pruning — after hundreds of commands, thousands of label widgets accumulate in the LVGL object tree, consuming heap. Labels are only freed when the user navigates away.

**What's needed:** Cap the number of visible terminal lines (e.g. 64), deleting the oldest label when the cap is reached. A `lv_obj_clean()` on the log container before adding the new line would also work but is more disruptive to the scroll state.

---

## Chat Screen

### Emoji truncation on multi-byte codepoints
The send path truncates message text by byte count (`chat_screen.cpp:933`), not codepoint boundary. If a 4-byte emoji (e.g. 🚀 = `\xF0\x9F\x9A\x80`) starts at byte 147 of 149, only 2 of the 4 bytes are copied, producing invalid UTF-8 which is then transmitted over the mesh.

**What's needed:** Replace byte-level truncation with codepoint-aware truncation — walk backward from the limit to ensure the last character boundary is valid, or reduce the max byte count to account for multi-byte trailing characters.

### Emoji rendering — picker has full color, but inline emoji are 4bpp grayscale
The emoji picker dialog uses 52 pre-rendered color images extracted from NotoColorEmoji.ttf (CBDT table), showing Android-style filled color emoji. However, emoji in chat message bubbles, channel names, and the autocomplete popup all render through the LVGL font fallback system:

- **Inline emoji**: Uses `emoji_font`, a 4bpp grayscale font generated from Noto Emoji (B&W outline font) via `lv_font_conv`. These render as low-resolution grayscale outlines on the 16-bit display. LVGL labels cannot embed `lv_image_dsc_t` objects — fonts and images are separate rendering paths.
- **363 codepoints**: Only 363 emoji codepoints are included in `emoji_font`. Any emoji outside this set displays as a blank placeholder box.
- **Variation selectors**: Mobile clients append U+FE0F (VARIATION SELECTOR-16) to emoji, e.g. `❤️` = U+2764 + U+FE0F. The font doesn't include U+FE0F, so LVGL renders a placeholder box after every variation-selector emoji. A `strip_variation_selectors()` helper is in `chat_screen.cpp` to remove these before display.
- **Autocomplete**: Shows color images for the 52 picker emoji via `lv_img`, falls back to font glyphs for the remaining ~290. The color images are the same CBDT-extracted ones used in the picker.
- **Emoji size mismatch**: `emoji_font` uses 16px glyphs but chat message labels use 12px primary fonts. Emoji render 33% larger than neighboring text.

**How to fix this properly:** Either (a) regenerate `emoji_font` at matching sizes (12px, 10px), or (b) refactor chat bubbles to use `lv_spangroup` with mixed image+text spans, or (c) port the LVGL FreeType engine integration to render the CBDT color font directly.

## SPI / Display

### Display and SD card share the same SPI host
The display uses `SPI3_HOST` (`display.cpp:45`) and the SD card also uses `HSPI` (`sdcard.cpp:31`). On ESP32-S3, `HSPI` maps to `SPI3_HOST` — the same SPI peripheral. Both configure the same host through different driver instances (LovyanGFX internal vs Arduino SPIClass). The comment in `sdcard.cpp:29` says "LovyanGFX and RadioLib use SPI2 (FSPI)" which is incorrect — the display code clearly uses SPI3_HOST. While this works in practice because each transaction reconfigures the GPIO matrix, clock speed differences (40MHz display vs 4MHz SD) create a fragile architecture where one driver's transaction can interfere with the other's register state.

**What's needed:** Either (a) move SD card to `FSPI` (`SPI2_HOST`), which is the default Arduino SPI bus and not used by the display, or (b) move the display to `SPI2_HOST` and keep SD on `SPI3`. Update the comment in `sdcard.cpp` to reflect the actual bus assignment.

## Map Screen

### Delete callback registered only once — map canvas becomes dangling after second visit

`slopos_map_reparent()` uses a `static bool delete_cb_registered` flag to guard callback registration (`map_renderer.cpp:631`). On the first map screen visit the callback is registered and fires on close, calling `slopos_map_deinit()` which frees `canvas_pixels`, tile cache, and sets `initialized = false`. On the second map screen visit, `slopos_map_init()` reallocates correctly and `slopos_map_reparent()` creates a new canvas — but `delete_cb_registered` is already `true`, so the cleanup callback is never registered on the new screen parent. When the second map screen closes, `slopos_map_deinit()` is never called: `canvas_pixels` (153 KB) and up to four tile cache buffers (~524 KB) stay allocated, and `initialized` stays `true`. On the third map screen visit, `slopos_map_init()` returns early, then `slopos_map_reparent()` calls `lv_obj_set_parent(map_canvas, new_parent)` with `map_canvas` pointing to the LVGL object from the second visit — which was already deleted. This is a use-after-free that corrupts the LVGL object tree or crashes.

**What's needed:** Reset `delete_cb_registered = false` inside `slopos_map_deinit()` so the callback is re-registered on every subsequent map screen open. Alternatively, remove the guard entirely and call `lv_obj_remove_event_cb_with_user_data` before re-adding the callback each time `slopos_map_reparent()` is called.

## Onboarding

### Empty node name accepted by wizard — saved to NVS and broadcast

The "Next" button handler in Step 1 checks `if (text && text[0])` before copying the name but still advances to step 2 regardless (`onboarding_screen.cpp:103-112`). If the user clears the input and presses Next, `s_name` retains its previous value (empty string on first boot). When Done is pressed, the empty name is written to NVS via `prefs_set()` and passed to `mesh::setOwnName()`. The device broadcasts adverts with no name — other nodes generate a fallback like `node_XX`, but the user's own UI shows a blank entry in Settings and the home screen.

**What's needed:** In the Next button event handler, add an early return if the input is empty: check `!text || !text[0]` and return before `s_step = 1`. Optionally flash the input field border `ACCENT_RED` to signal the required field.

### "Full Radio Setup" button discards wizard SF and TX power values

In Step 3 of the wizard, tapping "Full Radio Setup..." calls `radio_setup_screen_show()` directly without saving the current `s_sf`, `s_pwr`, or `s_freq` wizard state to prefs (`onboarding_screen.cpp:355-357`). The user configures radio settings in the Radio Setup screen and returns via the back button. The wizard's Done button then writes `s_sf`, `s_pwr`, and `s_freq` — still at the wizard-entered defaults — to NVS, overwriting whatever the Radio Setup screen had saved.

**What's needed:** When re-entering Step 3 after a navigation away, reload `s_sf`, `s_pwr`, and `s_freq` from `prefs_get()` so the wizard reflects the current saved state. Alternatively, remove the "Full Radio Setup" button from the wizard and instruct users to visit Settings → Radio Setup after completing onboarding.

## Chat Screen

### Channel message buffer has no DRAM fallback — messages silently dropped if PSRAM exhausted

`ensure_channel_buffer()` allocates the per-channel message store exclusively from PSRAM (`chat_screen.cpp:137`). If PSRAM allocation fails — for example when the map tile cache and canvas buffer are resident — `ch_msgs[idx]` remains null and `ch_msg_capacity[idx]` is set to 0 with no error notification. Every subsequent `append_channel_message()` call checks `has_channel_buffer()` and silently returns without storing or displaying the message. Users see an empty channel with no indication that incoming messages are being discarded.

**What's needed:** Add a DRAM fallback: if `heap_caps_malloc(MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM)` fails, retry with `heap_caps_malloc(MALLOC_CAP_INTERNAL | MALLOC_CAP_8BIT)`. Since DRAM is limited (~320 KB total), consider allocating at a reduced capacity (e.g. `CHAT_MSGS_MIN_CAP = 8` messages) when falling back to DRAM, and notify the user that history is limited.

## Settings

### `makeEpoch` may dereference stale TZ environment pointer after `setenv`

In `mesh_wrapper.cpp:465-470`, `makeEpoch()` stores the current TZ string via `getenv("TZ")`, then calls `setenv("TZ", "UTC0", 1)` to force UTC before `mktime()`. On ESP32/newlib, `getenv()` returns a pointer directly into the environment's internal string storage. The subsequent `setenv()` with overwrite=1 frees and replaces that string, leaving `old_tz` as a dangling pointer. The later `setenv("TZ", old_tz, 1)` restoring the old timezone reads from the freed pointer — undefined behavior that can manifest as corrupted timezone state or a crash when the user saves the date/time in Settings or Onboarding.

**What's needed:** Copy the old TZ value to a stack buffer before calling `setenv`:
```cpp
char old_tz_buf[64] = {};
const char* old_tz_raw = getenv("TZ");
if (old_tz_raw) strncpy(old_tz_buf, old_tz_raw, sizeof(old_tz_buf) - 1);
// use old_tz_buf for restoration; check old_tz_buf[0] instead of old_tz_raw
```

## Diagnostics

### ~~Debug mode issues~~ Fixed
When `SLOPOS_TRACKBALL_DEBUG_SHADOW` is defined (`trackball.cpp:91-93`), the debug print fires but the event is short-circuited — all trackball input is silently dropped during shadow debugging. 

The `debug.h` header declares functions unconditionally, but `debug.cpp` wraps all implementation in `#if defined(SLOPOS_DEBUG)`. Any non-debug code that calls a debug function will get a linker error. Current call sites are properly guarded, but this is a latent risk for future code.

**Fixed:** Shadow debug mode now logs events and still queues them. `debug.h` declarations guarded behind `#if defined(SLOPOS_DEBUG)` with empty inline stubs for non-debug builds.
