## Companion command support

SigurdOS T-Deck implements the companion commands used for normal setup,
contacts, channels, text messaging, offline sync, status, telemetry, tracing,
signing, and configuration. Recognition of a command identifier does not imply
that its operation is supported.

This matrix describes the pinned MeshCore protocol at submodule commit
`60ea4a91bf14363e837037a79ce1bff7fa37483f`.

| Command family | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| App/device query and time | Supported | Includes app start, device query, connection, time, battery/storage, and stats |
| Contacts and adverts | Supported | Import/export/update/remove/share, advert path/name/location, self advert, and path reset |
| Channels and text messages | Supported with one wire-format exception | Channel configuration/data/text, direct text, login, path discovery, and offline message sync are supported. `CMD_SET_CHANNEL` accepts the 16-byte-secret form; the 32-byte-secret form returns `ERR_CODE_UNSUPPORTED_CMD` |
| Direct raw data (`CMD_SEND_RAW_DATA`) | Restricted | Accepts explicit 0–63-byte one-byte-hash paths only; the `0xFF` flood sentinel is rejected. Received raw payloads use `PUSH_CODE_RAW_DATA` |
| Zero-hop control data (`CMD_SEND_CONTROL_DATA`) | Supported | Requires the control high bit and always uses zero-hop routing; invalid non-control payloads return `ERR_CODE_ILLEGAL_ARG`. Received controls use `PUSH_CODE_CONTROL_DATA` |
| Radio, tuning, flood scope, and custom variables | Supported | Subject to T-Deck radio-region and TX-safety gates |
| Binary and anonymous peer requests (`CMD_SEND_BINARY_REQ`, `CMD_SEND_ANON_REQ`) | Supported | Requests are sent through `BaseChatMesh`; matching replies emit `PUSH_CODE_BINARY_RESPONSE`. Anonymous requests may use transient contacts |
| Status, telemetry, and trace | Supported | Standard request/response and async push flows |
| Identity import/export and signing | Supported | Factory reset remains guarded by the authenticated protocol contract |
| `CMD_SEND_RAW_PACKET` | Unsupported | Returns `ERR_CODE_UNSUPPORTED_CMD`; arbitrary packet injection is not exposed |

Of the 58 defined command IDs, `CMD_SEND_RAW_PACKET` is the only command that is
fully refused. This is an explicit policy decision: arbitrary parsed-packet
injection is not exposed. `CMD_SEND_RAW_DATA` is available only for an explicit
one-byte-hash path and rejects flood routing; `CMD_SEND_CONTROL_DATA` is
available only for the zero-hop high-bit control form. Clients must also handle
`ERR_CODE_UNSUPPORTED_CMD` if they send the unsupported 32-byte-secret variant
of `CMD_SET_CHANNEL`.

All 17 `PUSH_CODE_*` identifiers are defined. `PUSH_CODE_LOG_RX_DATA` (`0x88`)
is not currently emitted. `PUSH_CODE_BINARY_RESPONSE` (`0x8C`) is emitted by
`pushBinaryResponse()` when a matching binary or anonymous request response
arrives; unmatched or expired tags are discarded.

Release interoperability should cover the official Android and iOS apps plus a
stock MeshCore companion radio. Core text messaging compatibility is broader
than the deliberately refused raw-packet injection command.

## Device-authored message visibility

The companion protocol has **no official PUSH code for device-authored
messages**. The protocol's push model only surfaces:

* messages the connected app **sent** (`CMD_SEND_TXT_MSG` → `SEND_CONFIRMED`)
* messages **received over RF** (offline queue → `SYNC_NEXT_MESSAGE`)

A message **typed on the T-Deck keyboard** will transmit correctly over LoRa
but will **not appear in the official app thread**. The T-Deck is the source of
truth for locally-authored messages; the app sees only what it sent or what
arrived from the mesh.

SigurdOS does **not** synthesize fake `CONTACT_MSG_RECV` frames for self-sent
messages — this would misattribute the sender and break reply/ack logic.
Future protocol extensions to close this gap require a cooperating client.
