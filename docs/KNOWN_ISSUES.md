## Launcher Compatibility

### SigurdOS doesn't work under bmorcelli/Launcher

[Launcher](https://github.com/bmorcelli/Launcher) is an ESP32 app launcher with explicit T-Deck support (display, touch, keyboard, SD card). A user tried running SigurdOS as a Launcher-launched app and ran into problems — the keyboard doesn't work properly, and many other things break.

**Root cause:** SigurdOS is built as standalone firmware that expects full hardware control at boot. Launcher initialises the display, keyboard, I2C, SPI, and LoRa pins before handing off, which leaves GPIOs, peripheral registers, and I2C bus state in an incompatible state when SigurdOS starts.

**Status:** Not planned. SigurdOS is designed as standalone firmware, not a Launcher app. Fixing this would require deep changes to every HAL driver to detect and handle pre-initialised peripherals.
