# Release evidence

Every release PR uses `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/release.md`. The machine-readable inventory in `ci/release_evidence_requirements.json` is the source of truth; CI fails if a requirement disappears from the template.

## Publication gate

A tag is publishable only when `release-evidence/<tag>.json` exists at the tagged
commit and passes `scripts/verify_release_evidence.py`. This checked-in source
evidence names the tag, contains a fresh passing record for every requirement,
links to reviewed evidence, and identifies firmware and peer versions for
hardware checks.

The tag workflow then builds once, validates the complete artifact directory,
and generates `release-evidence.json` as a post-build attestation. That published
attestation adds the exact tagged commit, the SHA-256 of the checked-in source
evidence, and hashes of every release artifact. CI validates those hashes against
the actual bytes immediately before upload. Keeping commit and artifact hashes
out of the checked-in schema avoids an impossible self-reference: editing a
tracked evidence file changes the commit it would claim to identify. These
SHA-256 values prove byte consistency, not publisher identity: **checksums are
not signatures**. See [Security model](SECURITY_MODEL.md#firmware-update-trust).

Use this shape (repeat the requirement object for every ID in the requirements inventory):

```json
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "tag": "<current-tag>",
  "generated_at": "2026-07-14T18:00:00Z",
  "requirements": [
    {
      "id": "INT-BLE",
      "outcome": "pass",
      "evidence_url": "<reviewed-evidence-url>",
      "tested_at": "2026-07-14",
      "firmware_version": "<current-tag>",
      "peer_version": "official-client-version"
    }
  ]
}
```

Validate checked-in source evidence before building:

```bash
python3 scripts/verify_release_evidence.py \
  --evidence release-evidence/<tag>.json \
  --tag "<tag>"
```

After flattening the release build into `artifacts/`, generate and immediately
recheck the byte-bound attestation:

```bash
python3 scripts/verify_release_evidence.py \
  --evidence release-evidence/<tag>.json \
  --commit "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" --tag "<tag>" \
  --artifacts-dir artifacts \
  --write-attestation artifacts/release-evidence.json
python3 scripts/verify_release_evidence.py \
  --attestation artifacts/release-evidence.json \
  --commit "$(git rev-parse HEAD)" --tag "<tag>" \
  --artifacts-dir artifacts
```

The attestation covers `firmware.bin`, both release-level merged/Launcher
images, `firmware-debug.bin`, the ESP Web Tools manifest, build metadata, and
all six web-flasher component/full/Launcher binaries. Legacy schema-1 evidence
is still parsed, but any declared hashes must cover and exactly match this full
set during post-build verification.

For tagged releases, the workflow also hashes every published input (including
the manifest, build metadata, and release evidence) into `SHA256SUMS.txt`, then
uses GitHub's OIDC identity to create `SHA256SUMS.sigstore.json`. Verify it with
Cosign before trusting the checksum file:

```bash
cosign verify-blob \
  --bundle SHA256SUMS.sigstore.json \
  --certificate-identity-regexp \
    '^https://github.com/hermes-gadget/SigurdOS-tdeck/.github/workflows/build-release.yml@refs/tags/' \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  SHA256SUMS.txt
sha256sum --check SHA256SUMS.txt
```

GitHub build-provenance attestations bind the same release files to the tagged
workflow run and can be checked with `gh attestation verify <file> --repo
hermes-gadget/SigurdOS-tdeck`. These publisher signatures do not enable ESP32-S3
secure boot or device-side signed OTA verification; those require a separate
device-key provisioning and rollback policy.

## Dependency pin policy

Every build dependency must resolve without local Git configuration:

- `lib/meshcore` is an exact gitlink. Its object must be publicly fetchable
  from the URL committed in `.gitmodules`; a maintainer-owned read-only mirror
  is acceptable, but `insteadOf` rules, unpublished fork objects, and deleted
  branches are not.
- PlatformIO application libraries use exact registry versions or immutable
  upstream commit archives. Branch names, version ranges, and mutable release
  downloads are not accepted as build pins.
- `ci/platformio-packages.lock` records the resolved package graph. A dependency
  PR reviews the declared pin, resolved graph, license/security inventory,
  affected firmware builds, and native tests together.

Normal build/test jobs key the shared immutable-download cache from the complete
declared and resolved dependency inputs. The dependency-refresh job is the one
exception: it restores a pre-update bootstrap cache before changing the selected
pin, then regenerates `ci/platformio-packages.lock`; the resulting PR is built
and tested by normal CI using the new complete hash.
The security inventory job also bypasses the package cache intentionally so its
scheduled dependency resolution observes the current registries and audit data;
it does not produce release build artifacts.

Before merging a gitlink change, initialize it in a clean clone rather than
relying on objects already present in a developer checkout:

```bash
clean_root="$(mktemp -d)"
git clone --recurse-submodules \
  https://github.com/hermes-gadget/SigurdOS-tdeck.git \
  "$clean_root/SigurdOS-tdeck"
git -C "$clean_root/SigurdOS-tdeck/lib/meshcore" rev-parse HEAD
```

The printed SHA must equal the superproject gitlink. Then run the companion
verification below and the affected build matrix. A submodule update is not a
hash-only maintenance change: reconcile local MeshCore patches and contact,
path, room-connection, transport-key, and persistence behaviour explicitly.

## Companion interop and golden frames

Run the official USB client matrix as documented in `scripts/official-meshcore-client-test/README.md` and the BLE scenarios in `docs/COMPANION_BLE_TEST_ENV.md`. Record firmware versions, date, pass/fail per case, and links to sanitized output. Do not record device IDs, public keys, contact names, message contents, credentials, or private keys.

The checked-in golden corpus is tied to the exact MeshCore submodule commit and SHA-256 of stock `examples/companion_radio/MyMesh.cpp`:

```bash
python3 scripts/verify_companion_golden_frames.py
```

The corpus also records a full public-upstream commit, its stock source digest,
and a canonical digest of all numeric `CMD_*`, `RESP_*`, `PUSH_*`, and
`ERR_*` values. To review a newly fetched public-upstream candidate:

```bash
git -C lib/meshcore fetch https://github.com/meshcore-dev/MeshCore.git main
python3 scripts/verify_companion_golden_frames.py \
  --candidate-ref FETCH_HEAD --json
```

The command resolves and prints the candidate's immutable full SHA. It fails if
the candidate changes any numeric protocol code and additionally verifies the
recorded source digest when the candidate is the reviewed-upstream commit.
New or changed frame layouts still require source-diff review and corresponding
golden/native assertions; numeric-code compatibility alone is not a layout
claim.

When either the submodule or reviewed-upstream baseline changes, review stock
protocol constants and frame layouts before updating the commit, source digest,
protocol digest, and corpus. A hash-only update is not review. Run both the
pinned and candidate commands plus:

```bash
pio test -e native_test -f test_companion_protocol -v
pio test -e native_sanitize -f test_companion_protocol -v
```

The protocol module includes deterministic stateful offline-sync coverage that
combines repeated app starts, bounded-page refill, write rejection, disconnect,
reconnect, retry, ordering, and durable delivered markers. This is the required
property/sequence gate for dependency refreshes; focused tests remain required
for any newly introduced state machine.

## Privacy-safe soak reports

Use a debug build at verbosity level 2 and capture at least 10 minutes (at least 120 `[stat]` samples spanning 600 seconds) for each scenario. Idle means the home screen with radio and configured transports running. Active means repeated screen navigation, message send/receive, map use, and companion reconnects representative of normal operation.

```bash
python3 scripts/analyze_soak_log.py idle.log \
  --scenario idle --json-out idle.json --markdown-out idle.md
python3 scripts/analyze_soak_log.py active.log \
  --scenario active --json-out active.json --markdown-out active.md
```

The reports contain only numeric memory summaries and a source-log digest. Attach the reports, not raw serial logs. Review raw logs locally for secrets before retaining them. Defaults fail on fewer than 120 samples, a span shorter than 600 seconds, non-monotonic timestamps, heap range over 16 KiB, or first-to-last heap drop over 8 KiB.

## OTA matrix

Test the final release artifact and record evidence for:

- successful authenticated upgrade with settings and stores preserved;
- no update available;
- missing and rejected credentials;
- offline, TLS, HTTP error, and truncated download paths;
- invalid image or write failure, followed by a clean reboot into a known-good image.
- an image with a lower security epoch, rejected before activation;
- the current and alternate maintained TLS roots, plus an expired/untrusted
  chain and the documented offline recovery path;
- an explicit firmware-signature result. Until device-side signature checking
  exists, record this as a known gap; a passing checksum is not a substitute.

Companion security evidence also covers BLE bond revocation and verifies that
factory reset prevents an old bond from silently reconnecting. USB evidence
must label the connected host as trusted because companion USB has no protocol
authentication. See [Security model](SECURITY_MODEL.md#release-evidence).

Use versioned release URLs. A negative test passes only when the error is bounded, the UI remains usable or reboots intentionally, and a bootable image is retained.

## Launcher matrix

Follow `docs/LAUNCHER.md` with the final Launcher artifact. Verify environment detection, update ownership/OTA gating, handoff back to Launcher, relaunch, and persistence of settings, contacts, channels, and messages. Record Launcher and SigurdOS versions without recording a device identifier.

## Release artifacts and warnings

The tag workflow validates source evidence before building, runs native
sanitizers, verifies the resolved PlatformIO graph, and validates the generated
manifest, image layouts, exact aliases, offsets, provenance, and SHA-256 values
before promotion. Confirm those results in the release PR. The first-party
warning gate parses only compiler warnings whose paths start with `src/`;
third-party warnings do not spend this budget. When a warning is fixed, reduce
`ci/first_party_warnings.json` in the same PR so the debt cannot return.

## KrabOS M0 exact-device admission

The KrabOS exact-device path is a hardware gate, not a substitute for hardware
evidence. Before an operator runs the executor from PR #12, all of the
following must be provisioned and reviewed privately:

- a mode-0600, runner-owned fixture configuration naming one `/dev/serial/by-id`
  T-Deck Plus and explicitly forbidding the D1L and RF-peer identities;
- the pre-provisioned shared hardware lock and the approved, RF-off recovery
  procedure; and
- the authorized fixture, firmware commit, and release-role metadata. These
  details, along with location, identity, full-flash backups, and raw serial
  evidence, stay off GitHub.

The executor must bind the exact USB properties and eFuse MAC, reject a busy or
ambiguous target, capture and hash the complete 16 MiB flash before erase, and
export the preserved state partitions before any candidate bytes run. It must
install and read back the RF-off recovery image before the candidate boot and
leave the fixture in that recovery posture after a failed or unqualified run.

Target-local serial markers are structural diagnostics only. They do not prove
that RF was silent or that a candidate advert/DM/channel reached a peer. The
release receipt therefore requires an independently observed, exact-image-bound
evidence packet for the RF gates. A receipt with only target-local markers must
remain ineligible, even when its JSON schema and redaction checks pass.

Current PR #12 invokes `exact_device_release.py release` without the required
`--observer-*` admission inputs. That is an honest fail-closed blocker: the
hardware path cannot produce an eligible release receipt until the independent
observer packet, its source identity, and its bundle digest are wired into both
the release command and `check-public`.

Steward's remaining M0 operator gates are: provision and review the private
fixture authorization; run the pinned native/script/build checks; perform the
exact-device identity and full-backup checks; execute the RF-off recovery drill
with the independent observer; verify the redacted receipt and exact artifact
hashes; and retain the private recovery/backup evidence for supervised review.
